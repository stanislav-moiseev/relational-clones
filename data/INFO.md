# Precomputed closure

`closure-two-uniq-preds.2016`

Contains a precomputed closure $<{p1, p2}> ∩ ClosureUniquePreds$ for all pairs
$(p1, p2)$ of _closure-unique_ predicates. The resulting predicate set contains
_closure-unique_ predicates only.

`closure-clone-pred.2016`

Contains all clones of degree <= 2 in a form of a precomputed table
$(Clone, p) ↦ ⟨Clone ∪ {p}⟩ ∩ ClosureUniquePreds$.
